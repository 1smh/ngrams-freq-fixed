To implement a genre classification tool using the Ngram API, you can follow these steps:

1. Data Collection
Collect Texts: Gather a dataset of texts with labeled genres (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, romance, horror, etc.). You can use books, articles, or online datasets.
Extract Ngrams: Use the Ngram API to obtain frequency data for ngrams from your dataset. This will provide insights into common and unique phrases for each genre.
2. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Clean the collected texts by removing special characters, punctuation, and stopwords (common words like "the", "is", etc.) that may not add significant meaning.
Ngram Extraction: Extract ngrams from the cleaned texts and create a frequency distribution of these ngrams for each genre.
3. Feature Engineering
Create Features: Construct features based on the frequency of ngrams. You could use:
Absolute frequency of ngrams.
Relative frequency (normalized counts) of ngrams.
Unique ngram counts.
Vectorization: Convert the ngram frequency data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms, like a term-document matrix.
4. Model Training
Choose a Model: Select a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or more advanced models like Support Vector Machines or neural networks).
Train the Model: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training set using the ngram features and their corresponding genres.
5. Model Evaluation
Test the Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tune Hyperparameters: Experiment with different parameters and techniques to improve the model's performance.
6. Implementation
Build an Interface: Create a user interface where users can input a text snippet, and the model predicts its genre based on the trained ngram features.
Integration with the Ngram API: Optionally, allow users to fetch ngram data from the Ngram API directly to analyze how their text compares to existing genres.
7. Further Enhancements
User Feedback: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can indicate whether the prediction was correct, allowing the model to learn and improve over time.
Visualizations: Include visualizations of ngram distributions and comparisons across genres to enhance user understanding.
Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how you might extract ngrams and train a model:

python
Copy code
import requests
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Function to fetch ngram data
def fetch_ngrams(corpus, query):
    NGRAMS_API = "https://api.ngrams.dev"
    url = f"{NGRAMS_API}/{corpus}/search"
    parameters = {'query': query, 'limit': 10}
    response = requests.get(url, params=parameters)
    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None

# Sample dataset
texts = ['Sample text from genre one.', 'Another example from genre two.']
genres = ['genre_one', 'genre_two']

# Ngram extraction
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts).toarray()

# Train the model
y = genres
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
This is a high-level overview of the process. You can customize each step based on your goals, available data, and preferred tools or frameworks.
